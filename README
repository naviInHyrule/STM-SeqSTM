This package contains the java source code and binaries for the Segmented 
Topic Model (STM) described in:

Lan Du, Wray Buntine and Huidong Jin, "A segmented topic model based on the 
two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process", Mach. Learn., 81(1):5â€“19.

===========================================================================

The directory contents of this distribution are as follows:

./
eval   				- A unix script for evaluating a segmenter.
build.xml        		- An ant script for building the source
README           		- This documentation
./bin            		- The compiled java class files
./configs        		- Configuration files for running various experiments.
./configs/example.config	- An example configuration file

./DataSets            		- Corpora for training/testing the model
./DataSets/test			- A test dataset that contains 7 training documents 
				  and 3 testing documents
./lib              		- Library dependencies
./src         			- The java source files
./results          		- The result output

This is a java-based, platform-independent implementation.  The class files
provided here require Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6.0 or higher.  If you
have a lower version, you may recompile by running "ant rebuild."  They have
been tested to run when compiled to JRE 6.0.

============================================================
Building Instructions

The build system uses Jakarta Ant framework (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/).

To build in unix, set your current working directory to the root directory of
the distribution, where the file "build.xml" is located, and enter the
command "ant", optionally followed by target name (build or clean)

============================================================
Runing Instruction

This system contains the source code and an example dataset. To evaluate the system 
on a given dataset, 
	1) create a configuration file, see ./configs/example.config for more 
	   details about each configuration; 
	2) Accordingly modify the script ./eval by setting, for example, the 
	   the configuration file, the number to topics, the output file directory,
	   etc. Please see ./eval for details

Then, simply type

./eval

============================================================
Input data format

./DataSet/test contains 10 documents, in which there are 7 documents for training,
and 3 document for testing. Training and testing documents are distinguished by the
file extension. In the configuration file, training/testing document file extension
can be specified. Within each document, segments (e.g., paragraphs or sentences)
are separated by a blank line. Note "**********" denotes topic segmentation boundary,
which is not used in current release and can be omitted.
